# Fashion-Mnist
A MNIST-like fashion product database

The original dataset can be found here: "https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist/tree/master/data/fashion"

In The first notebook "FMNIST.ipynb", I have used simple base CNN model to predict the cloth images. In the second notebook I will use this dataset on different ML classification algorithms.
